[b]General[/b]: At ease, soldiers. We have an important battle ahead of us, today. Our lovely trebuchet will finally get some action.
[b]Trebuchet squads[/b]: [i]Screams in excitement[/i]
[b]General[/b]: Good, good! Today, we are to conquer the castle and the treasures within. We have been starving them for long enough. They are weak after weeks of no supplies.
[b]General[/b]: The king will be proud and I am sure the reward for the successful conquest will be adequate. For every. One. Of. You. My loyal soldiers.
[i]Meanwhile at the castle[/i]
[b]Princess[/b]: Well, well, my ladies, this brew has turned out absolutely lovely.
[b]One of the ladies[/b]: I am so glad! But... Shouldn't we be worried about the soldiers outside?
[b]Princess[/b]: Shush! There is nothing to be worried about! Go ahead, pour yourselves a cup!
[b]Another lady[/b]: Ummm, but my eye just caught a glimpse of a fully loaded trebuchet.
[b]Princess[/b]: Come on now! Here, have some of these impeccable cookies, I have also made just for this special occasion!
[b]A different lady[/b]: Yes, yes! They are truly tasteful. But what about the battle roar just outside the windows. It seems, that the gate has been breached.
[b]Princess[/b]: No, no. No. NO! The only breach is the ungrateful attitude of all of you. I have spent all day baking those cookies. And Y E A R S perfecting my brew recipe.
[b]Princess[/b]: So stop moaning about soldiers, trebuchets and some boring bloodshed. Let's just enjoy the lovely time together with some tea.
[b]Princess[/b]: So, [i]Another lady[/i], what about the dress I have sent you. Did you...
[i]Doors blast open[/i]
[b]General[/b]: Here you are! Soldiers, take hold of them! The king will be very, very pleased we took them alive!
[b]Marie[/b]: Henry, why do you always have to do this?!
[b]One of her friends[/b]: Here we go again...
[b]Henry[/b]: Do what? We have successfully breached your measly defences.
[b]Marie[/b]: There are no defences. I am having a tea party with my friends!
[b]Henry[/b]: Ha-ha, no defences. Exactly! Soldiers, take them!
[b]Marie[/b]: No, go away! Leave us alone!
[i]Marie starts to cry a little[/i]
[b]Henry[/b]: Ha-ha, easy victory! They are not even fighting back.
[b]Another of her friends[/b]: Let's go home, this is annoying, they are about to start fighting again.
[i]Marie, as she's crying, starts to scratch and bite at Henry[/i]
[b]Marie[/b]: I [i]sob[/i] H A T E you! [i]sob[/i]
[i]Henry starts pulling her hair[/i]
[b]Marie[/b]: O U C H. STOP IT! AaaaAaaaAAAaaa! Mum. MUM! M U M!
[b]Mum[/b]: What's going on here? Stop it! Leave each other alone!
[i]Mum splits them apart. Henry's panting and lusting for more combat. Marie just sits on the ground, hugging her knees and sobbing.[/i]
[b]Mum[/b]: So what happened?
[b]Henry[/b]: We have conquered the castle and she resisted the shackles!
