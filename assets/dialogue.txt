[b]General[/b]: At ease, soldiers. We have an important battle ahead of us, today. Our lovely trebuchet will finally get some action.
[b]Trebuchet squads[/b]: [i]Screams in excitement[/i]
[b]General[/b]: Good, good! Today, we are to conquer the castle and the treasures within. We have been starving them for long enough. They are weak after weeks of no supplies.
[b]General[/b]: The king will be proud and I am sure the reward for the successful conquest will be adequate. For every. One. Of. You. My loyal soldiers.
[i]Meanwhile at the castle[/i]
[b]Princess[/b]: Well, well, my ladies, this brew has turned out absolutely lovely.
[b]One of the ladies[/b]: I am so glad! But... Shouldn't we be worried about the soldiers outside?
[b]Princess[/b]: Shush! There is nothing to be worried about! Go ahead, pour yourselves a cup!
[b]Another lady[/b]: Ummm, but my eye just caught a glimpse of a fully loaded trebuchet.
[b]Princess[/b]: Come on now! Here, have some of these impeccable cookies, I have also made just for this special occasion!
[b]A different lady[/b]: Yes, yes! They are truly tasteful. But what about the battle roar just outside the windows. It seems, that the gate has been breached.
[b]Princess[/b]: No, no. No. NO! The only breach is the ungrateful attitude of all of you. I have spent all day baking those cookies. And Y E A R S perfecting my brew recipe.
[b]Princess[/b]: So stop moaning about soldiers, trebuchets and some boring bloodshed. Let's just enjoy the lovely time together with some tea.
[b]Princess[/b]: So, [i]Another lady[/i], what about the dress I have sent you. Did you...
[i]Doors blast open[/i]
[b]General[/b]: Here you are! Soldiers, take hold of them! The king will be very, very pleased we took them alive!
[b]Marie[/b]: Henry, why do you always have to do this?!
[b]One of her friends[/b]: Here we go again...
[b]Henry[/b]: Do what? We have successfully breached your measly defences.
[b]Marie[/b]: There are no defences. I am having a tea party with my friends!
[b]Henry[/b]: Ha-ha, no defences. Exactly! Soldiers, take them!
[b]Marie[/b]: No, go away! Leave us alone!
[i]Marie starts to cry a little[/i]
[b]Henry[/b]: Ha-ha, easy victory! They are not even fighting back.
[b]Another of her friends[/b]: Let's go home, this is annoying, they are about to start fighting again.
[i]Marie, as she's crying, starts to scratch and bite at Henry[/i]
[b]Marie[/b]: I [i]sob[/i] H A T E you! [i]sob[/i]
[i]Henry starts pulling her hair[/i]
[b]Marie[/b]: O U C H. STOP IT! AaaaAaaaAAAaaa! Mum. MUM! M U M!
[b]Mum[/b]: What's going on here? Stop it! Leave each other alone!
[i]Mum splits them apart. Henry's panting and lusting for more combat. Marie just sits on the ground, hugging her knees and sobbing.[/i]
[b]Mum[/b]: So what happened?
[b]Henry[/b]: We have conquered the castle and she resisted the shackles!
[b]Marie[/b]: I was having a tea party with my friends, when  HE  burst in and COMPLETELY ruined it. [i]sob[/i]
[b]Mum[/b]: Alright, alright, calm down both of you. Henry, why did you feel the need to attack the castle?
[b]Henry[/b]: Because that's what army generals do, Mum! They conquer castles and win treasures!
[b]Mum[/b]: And Marie, you wanted to have a peaceful teatime with the ladies, right?
[b]Marie[/b]: Yes, Mum. I just wanted to be the princesses and have a nice time without any quarells.
[b]Mum[/b]: I see. We will find a way for both of you to play together. How about... Henry, listen. What if your army wasn't here to attack the castle, but to protect it instead?
[b]Henry[/b]: Protect it, huh? From what?
[b]Mum[/b]: From the evil sorceress who is planning to cast the kingdom into an eternity of boredom. As the army general, you will defend the castle, the princess and her friends.
[b]Mum[/b]: And I... Will be the  S O R C E R E S S!
[b]Marie[/b] [i](wiping away tears)[/i]: Really? That could be fun! We will give the brave soldiers cookies and tea as the reward!
[b]Henry[/b]: That sounds cool! We will set up defences and prepare for an epic battle against the sorceress!
[b]Mum[/b]: Excellent! Now, let's set the scene. Marie, you and your friends continue your teatime. Henry, gather your soldiers and prepare for the sorceress's attack. I'll go get my wicked robes and the magic staff!
[i]The children's faces light up with excitement as they return to their roles, now with a shared goal.[/i]
[b]General[/b]: Soldiers, to arms! We must protect the the castle, and ladies within, from the evil sorceress. Prepare the defences. And don't forget your magical pendants!
[b]Trebuchet squads[/b]: Yes, sir! For the princess and the kingdom!
[b]Princess[/b]: Oh, brave general, we are ever so grateful for your protection. Please join us for tea once the threat has been vanquished. And bring the trebuchet men with you.
[b]General[/b]: It would be an honor, Princess. But first, we must defend the castle with all our might!
[i]Mum enters, draped in a dark cloak, her hands raised dramatically, holding the staff.[/i]
[b]Sorceress[/b]: A H-H A-H A! You think you can stop me, the most powerful sorceress in the whole kingdom? I shall cast a spell of boredom and no cookies over you!
[b]General[/b]: Soldiers, ready yourselves! She shall not pass!
[b]Trebuchet squads[/b]: Ready to fire, sir!
[b]Princess[/b]: Be strong, general. We believe in you!
[i]The play resumes with laughter, joyful screams and excitement. While the children with their mum enjoy a play where their imagination can soar together.[/i]
[b]Mum[/b] [i](as Sorceress)[/i]: You may have won this time, General, but I shall return!
[b]General[/b]: And we will be ready for you, Sorceress! The kingdom remains safe, thanks to the princess's cookies and my army's bravery!
[b]Princess[/b]: Now, let us celebrate with cookies and the finest tea in the kingdom!
[b]Trebuchet squad[/b]: T E A  and  C O O K I E S!
[i]The children and their mother cheer and pretend to feast, the conflict forgotten, replaced by the joy of shared play.[/i]
[i]And they played happily ever after[/i]
[b]Mrs. Mum[/b]: Oh, you're done with the fence already. Thanks!
